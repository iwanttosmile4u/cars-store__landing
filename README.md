## Description

I've made responsive layout of the online car store. 
Main functionality: 
1. Click on select input, which named 'Model', and choose some car model. After that you'll see the filtered cars cards. Also you can filter cars by a year. 
2. Subscription form. When you'll enter invalid email you can see text error under the input. Example of a valid email: yourmail@mail.com.

## Technologies that I used:

- HTML5;
- Bootstrap 5;
- SCSS;
- BEM-methodology;
- JS;
- Gulp;
- npm tools;

### To start the project locally you need to enter in terminal such command:
```

```
## Dependencies
